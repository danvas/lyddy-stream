# lyddy-stream
Lyddy is a sound-sharing social networking service, launched May 2019 exclusively as a web application (Chrome/Firefox). 

The app allows users to post third-party audio sources to the service, which can be organized with tags. 

A user's posts can be shared publicly or with pre-approved followers. Users can browse other users' content by tags. Users can "Like" posts, and follow other users to add their content to the "home stream".
